##### Tell me about a time you've worked with a difficult internal stakeholder 
My approach to dealing with difficult stakeholders has always been:

* Engage - Directly engage with the stakeholder, meet or chat
* Listen - Listen to what they have to say, patiently.
* Understand - Understand their POV, even if it is impossible at some times
* Ask - Ask clarifying questions. Why? When? What?
* Engage again - Keep them in the loop until there is closure

For example, we were in the final stages of a very important, strategic project for our organization. I was leading the product efforts. We had completed 80% of the project and were racing towards the toughest 20% with 3 weeks left. I got a pretty heated email from one of the senior leaders in the organization that this project is a total failure and that we should stop all efforts towards this project.
The task in hand was 2 fold. Continue taking the project to the finish line. Bring the difficult stakeholder into the vision of the project. Bonus - excite them about the project.
The following were the specific actions I undertook:

Worked with the stakeholder's direct reports and identified all their concerns. - Engage/Listen/Understand/Ask
Verified against the backlog to see if all of their concerns have been properly prioritized in terms of - in progress, done, backlog and won't do. - Engage again
Verified with the stakeholder's direct reports that the previously set up sync-cadences work. - Ask
Built a dashboard that talked about the positive business KPIs due to the 80% launch and projected the full benefits.
Exposed the backlog visibility to add in new projects that could be leveraged using this project.
Presented all these data to the senior leader on the above. - Engage again
The senior leader had a few clarifying questions, but this time after consuming the above information they were more conducive to hearing out our plan of action and also started suggesting some ideas on the future roadmaps and improvements. They were happy with the results and were hoping to engage on the concerns that we disagreed on.

#####  Tell me about a time you've worked with a difficult vendor
# Situation: "At my last job, a customer came in cursing and yelling—the works. She was complaining about an item she wanted to return, but she didn't have her receipt.”

# Task: “I was the rep working at the counter that day, so I was responsible for handling customer inquiries and returns. I knew the customer’s reaction was out of frustration, so I didn't take it personally and I made sure she knew her concerns were being heard.”

# Action: “I listened carefully and apologized. I explained that I wasn't able to give her a cash refund without the receipt due to the company’s policy, but that I could allow her to have the same amount in store credit. I also recommended a replacement product that would better suit her needs and was similarly priced to the old product.”

# Result: “The customer was satisfied with the store credit, and she used it to purchase the replacement product that I recommended. It ended up being a win-win situation for everyone."
