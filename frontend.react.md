### 1. What are the advantages of using React?
MVC is generally abbreviated as Model View Controller.

1. Use of Virtual DOM to improve efficiency       
React uses virtual DOM to render the view. As the name suggests, virtual DOM is a virtual representation of the real DOM. Each time the data changes in a react app, a new virtual DOM gets created. Creating a virtual DOM is much faster than rendering the UI inside the browser. Therefore, with the use of virtual DOM, the efficiency of the app improves.

2. Gentle learning curve        
React has a gentle learning curve when compared to frameworks like Angular. Anyone with little knowledge of javascript can start building web applications using React.

3. SEO friendly     
React allows developers to develop engaging user interfaces that can be easily navigated in various search engines. It also allows server-side rendering, which boosts the SEO of an app.

4. Reusable components      
React uses **component-based architecture** for developing applications. Components are independent and reusable bits of code. These components can be shared across various applications having similar functionality. The re-use of components increases the pace of development.
Huge ecosystem of libraries to choose from
React provides you the freedom to choose the tools, libraries, and architecture for developing an application based on your requirement
