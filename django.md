#### 1. Explain Django Architecture?
Django follows the MVT (**Model View Template**) pattern which is based on the Model View Controller architecture. Itâ€™s slightly different from the MVC pattern as it maintains its own conventions, so, the controller is handled by the framework itself. The template is a presentation layer. It is an HTML file mixed with Django Template Language (DTL). The developer provides the model, the view, and the template then maps it to a URL, and finally, Django serves it to the user.

##### Model 
A model in Django refers to a class that maps to a **database table** or database collection. Each attribute of the Django model class represents a **database field**

#####  View  
They generally comprise HTML, CSS, and js in which dynamic variables and information are embedded with the help of views

#####  Template  
web request and returns a web response

#### 2. What is Django ORM?
This ORM (an acronym for Object Relational Mapper) enables us to **interact with databases** in a more pythonic way like we can **avoid writing raw queries**

#### 3. Explain user authentication in Django?
Django comes with a built-in user authentication system, which handles objects like users, groups, user-permissions, and few cookie-based user sessions. Django User authentication not only authenticates the user but also authorizes him.

The system consists and operates on these objects:

Users
Permissions
Groups
Password Hashing System
Forms Validation
A pluggable backend system
