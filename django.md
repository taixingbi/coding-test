#### 1. Explain Django Architecture?
Django follows the MVT (**Model View Template**) pattern which is based on the Model View Controller architecture. Itâ€™s slightly different from the MVC pattern as it maintains its own conventions, so, the controller is handled by the framework itself. The template is a presentation layer. It is an HTML file mixed with Django Template Language (DTL). The developer provides the model, the view, and the template then maps it to a URL, and finally, Django serves it to the user.
