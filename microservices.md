## Advantages 
#### Microservices are independently deployable and allow for more team autonomy
Each microservice can be deployed independently, as needed, enabling continuous improvement and faster app updates.
Specific microservices can be assigned to specific development teams, which allows them to focus solely on one service or feature. This means teams can work autonomously without worrying what’s going on with the rest of the app.

#### Microservices are independently scalable.
As demand for an app increases, it’s easier to scale using microservices. You can increase resources to the most needed microservices rather than scaling an entire app. This also means scaling is faster and often more cost-efficient as well.

####  Microservices reduce downtime through fault isolation.
If a specific microservice fails, you can isolate that failure to that single service and prevent cascading failures that would cause the app to crash. This fault isolation means that your critical application can stay up and running even when one of its modules fails.

####  The smaller codebase enables teams to more easily understand the code, making it simpler to maintain.
Microservice typically have small codebases, making them easier to maintain and deploy. It’s also much easier to keep the code clean and for teams to be wholly responsible for specific services.

## Disadvantages 
#### communication between services can be complex
#### debugging becomes more challenging with microservices
####  while unit testing may be easier with microservices, integration testing
