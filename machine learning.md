#### 1. What’s the trade-off between bias and variance?

**Bias** is error due to erroneous or overly simplistic assumptions in the learning algorithm you’re using
**Variance** is error due to too much complexity in the learning algorithm you’re using

#### 2. Explain how a ROC curve works.
The ROC curve is a graphical representation of the contrast between true positive rates and the false positive rate at various thresholds.

#### 3. Define precision and recall.
##### Recall is also known as the true positive rate: the amount of positives your model claims compared to the actual number of positives there are throughout the data.     
##### Precision is also known as the positive predictive value
