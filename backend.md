## 1 What REST stands for
REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. REST is web standards based architecture and uses HTTP Protocol for data communication. It revolves around resource where every component is a resource and a resource is accessed by a common interface using HTTP standard methods. REST was first introduced by Roy Fielding in 2000.

In REST architecture, a REST Server simply provides access to resources and REST client accesses and presents the resources. Here each resource is identified by URIs/ global IDs. REST uses various representations to represent a resource like text, JSON and XML. Now a days JSON is the most popular format being used in web services.

## 2 SQL vs NoSQL databases?
SQL databases store data in form of tables, rows, columns and records. This data is stored in a pre-defined data model which is not very much flexible for today's real-world highly growing applications

A NoSQL database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases (like SQL, Oracle, etc.).   
Types of NoSQL databases:   
. Document Oriented     
. Key Value      
. Graph    
. Column Oriented   

At the present time, the internet is loaded with big data, big users, big complexity etc. and also becoming more complex day by day. NoSQL is answer of all these problems; It is not a traditional database management system, not even a relational database management system (RDBMS). NoSQL stands for “Not Only SQL”. NoSQL is a type of database that can handle and sort all type of unstructured, messy and complicated data. It is just a new way to think about the database.

## 6 What is meant by Continuous Integration?
Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.

## 7 What are the advantages of Web Services
. Interoperability: Web services are accessible over network and runs on HTTP/SOAP protocol and uses XML/JSON to transport data, hence it can be developed in any programming language. Web service can be written in java programming and client can be PHP and vice versa.
. Reusability: One web service can be used by many client applications at the same time.
. Loose Coupling: Web services client code is totally independent with server code, so we have achieved loose coupling in our application.
Easy to deploy and integrate, just like web applications.
. Multiple service versions can be running at same time.
