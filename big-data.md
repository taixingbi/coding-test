### Hadoop

1. What are the basic differences between relational database and HDFS?



|| RDBMS  | Hadoop |
|-------------| ------------- | ------------- |
| Data Types	  | RDBMS relies on the structured data and the schema of the data is always known.  | Any kind of data can be stored into Hadoop i.e. Be it structured, unstructured or semi-structured.|
| Processing  | RDBMS provides limited or no processing capabilities.  | Hadoop allows us to process the data which is **distributed across the cluster in a parallel** fashion.|
| Schema on Read Vs. Write  | RDBMS is based on schema on **write policy** where schema validation is done before loading the data.  |On the contrary, Hadoop follows the schema on **read policy**. |
