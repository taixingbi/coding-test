### Hadoop

1. What are the basic differences between relational database and HDFS?

|| RDBMS  | Hadoop |
|-------------| ------------- | ------------- |
| Data Types	  | RDBMS relies on the structured data and the schema of the data is always known.  | Any kind of data can be stored into Hadoop i.e. Be it structured, unstructured or semi-structured.|
| Processing  | RDBMS provides limited or no processing capabilities.  | Hadoop allows us to process the data which is **distributed across the cluster in a parallel** fashion.|
| Schema on Read Vs. Write  | RDBMS is based on schema on **write policy** where schema validation is done before loading the data.  |On the contrary, Hadoop follows the schema on **read policy**. |

2. Explain “Big Data” and what are five V’s of Big Data?
* **Volume**: The volume represents the **amount of data** which is growing at an **exponential rate** i.e. in Petabytes and Exabytes. 
Velocity: Velocity refers to the rate at which data is growing, which is very fast. Today, yesterday’s data are considered as old data. Nowadays, social media is a major contributor to the velocity of growing data.
* **Variety**: Variety refers to the heterogeneity of data types. In another word, the data which are gathered has a **variety of formats** like videos, audios, csv, etc. So, these various formats represent the variety of data.
* **Veracity**: Veracity refers to the data in doubt or uncertainty of data available due to data inconsistency and incompleteness. Data available can sometimes get messy and may be difficult to trust. With many forms of big data, quality and accuracy are difficult to control. The volume is often the reason behind for the lack of quality and accuracy in the data.
* **Value**: It is all well and good to have access to big data but unless we can turn it into a value it is useless. By turning it into value I mean, Is it adding to the benefits of the organizations? Is the organization working on Big Data achieving high ROI (Return On Investment)? Unless, it adds to their profits by working on Big Data, it is useless.

3. What is Hadoop and its components. 
When “Big Data” emerged as a problem, Apache Hadoop evolved as a solution to it. Apache Hadoop is a **framework** which provides us various services or tools to **store and process Big Data**. It helps in analyzing Big Data and making business decisions out of it, which can’t be done efficiently and effectively using traditional systems.
